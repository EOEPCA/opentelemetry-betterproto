    The details of a partially successful export request.
    
     If the request is only partially accepted
     (i.e. when the server accepts only parts of the data and rejects the rest)
     the server MUST initialize the `partial_success` field and MUST
     set the `rejected_<signal>` with the number of items it rejected.
    
     Servers MAY also make use of the `partial_success` field to convey
     warnings/suggestions to senders even when the request was fully accepted.
     In such cases, the `rejected_<signal>` MUST have a value of `0` and
     the `error_message` MUST be non-empty.
    
     A `partial_success` message with an empty value (rejected_<signal> = 0 and
     `error_message` = "") is equivalent to it not being set/present. Senders
     SHOULD interpret it the same way as in the full success case.

     success or to convey warnings/suggestions during a full success. The message
     should offer guidance on how users can address such issues.
    
     error_message is an optional field. An error_message with an empty value
