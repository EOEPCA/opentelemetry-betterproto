# Python library for OpenTelemetry-proto based on python-betterproto

See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto and https://github.com/danielgtaylor/python-betterproto

Easiest way to (re)generate is to
- make sure the opentelemetry-proto submodule is updated `git submodule update`.
- run the makefile with the necessary dev dependencies, easiest with `uv run make` assuming `uv` is installed.
